Plans


a) Focus on Ordering
Popup with GrubHub, and it would order it through the GrubHub servers

Keep it simple, it could be a direct link to Grubhub


Goes to page and can search thing
The search would already be filled out hamburger@restaurant


//if they say where it was it would open to actual restaurant
//they click on the burger and other things


embedded grubhub


looker customer --- looking at food

order customer --- buyer of food --- address credit card attached
